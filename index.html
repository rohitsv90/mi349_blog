                <p>The PS5 is an upcoming home video game console being developed by Sony. It is expected to come out some time next month. The console itself looks very unique and fascinating 
                unlike the previous versions of the PlayStation. I am predicting that the console is going to sell in large units by the time it releases and that it will become very successful in the
                future. I got the chance to look at the homescreen and the overall user experience of the PS5. It looks very unique unlike the homescreen and the overall user experience from previous
                generation Playstation consoles. I am very excited to get this once it releases. I am a huge fan of Sony video games. The game exclusives are also very unique when it comes to the overall
                experience</p> 
                <h4 id="features">Some High Quality Features it has are:</h4>
                <ul class="list">

                    <li>Key exclusive games like Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Horizon Forbidden West, Sackboy: A Big Adventure etc.</li>

                <h3>AR/VR</h3>

                <p>AR/VR is the future of gaming. They have such and impact on gaming since they increase the overall experience of the user as it is the basis for the gaming industry to utilize
                even more in the future. It would increase the overall experience of the user because of how the users would experience playing the game in a real-world setting and how it would impact them alot. I personally do feel 
                that AR/VR would have a bright vision since it could bring a revolutionary change to explore the world of vivid imagination. PS VR is a good example since it did increase the overall experience of the user and Sony
                became very famous for how it shaped the experience of players to experience playing in the actual setting. Altough VR could involve eye tracking it still does have a bright future since it is meant to give gamers more
                experience and taste in playing video games and it could inspire other people out there as well to use VR systems in gaming.</p>
